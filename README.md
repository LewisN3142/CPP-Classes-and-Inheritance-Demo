# CPP-Classes-Inheritance-Demo

This repository contains the code used to demonstrate the functionality of classes and inheritence in C++ to a fellow Ph.D. student who was converting research code from python to C++ (a language they did not previously know) for efficiency. The code outputs debug text whenever a method is called, identifying which method and whether or not it came from the parent class or child class. The gramCalc() function computes a Gramian type quantity specific to the example I was discussing with my colleague at the time, but could easily be replaced with any other function which the user wants to call/inherit from a class.
